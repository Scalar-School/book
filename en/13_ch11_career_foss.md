# 11. Career in Free and Open Source Software Development

*"If a YouTube video goes down, we might lament the loss of valuable knowledge, but if an open source project goes down, it can literally break the internet."*

—Nadia Eghbal, Working in Public, The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software

Free and open source software is a fundamental pillar of modern digital society, promoting innovation, security, and inclusion. It offers a sustainable and ethical alternative to proprietary software, while also opening new career and professional development possibilities for individuals worldwide.

Today, working on FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) projects has become a viable career option distinct from the traditional corporate system. The importance of FOSS for humanity is immense. It allows anyone, regardless of financial resources, to access high-quality tools, promoting digital inclusion and equal opportunities.

Moreover, the transparency of open source increases security, as anyone can inspect and improve the code, reducing dependence on proprietary solutions and increasing trust in the software used.

## Benefits of Contributing to Open Source

In the open source community, some of the world's best programmers work on the most complex and challenging software problems. Participating in this community is extremely beneficial for a developer's resume for several reasons.

First, the collaborative nature of open source projects requires developers to have advanced technical skills and the ability to solve complex problems effectively. Contributing to these projects demonstrates that a developer can work in a team, communicate well, and solve difficult problems — skills highly valued by employers.

Open source projects are often responsible for some of the most significant technological innovations. Participating and contributing to these projects allows developers to work with the latest technologies and advances in the software field. This not only increases the developer's practical experience but also keeps their skills up to date with industry trends.

Furthermore, the visibility that comes with contributing to open source projects is invaluable. A developer's code and contributions are publicly accessible, allowing potential employers to directly see the quality of the work and the developer's level of commitment. This can lead to career opportunities, as many tech companies actively monitor these communities for talent.

Participating in the open source community also offers networking opportunities with other experienced and influential developers in the industry. These connections can lead to future collaborations, job recommendations, and mentorship, all of which can be extremely valuable for career development.

Contrary to the misconception that open source developers are only volunteers, many start as volunteers to demonstrate their work ethic and network. However, there are many opportunities to work in truly profitable positions.

## Financial Opportunities in Open Source

Most open source projects are, in fact, priced in dollars. This is because the US dollar is the most widely accepted and used currency internationally, especially in online transactions and crowdfunding platforms. This standard facilitates the coordination of projects and payments among developers from different countries.

Voluntarily contributing to open source projects allows developers to build a public portfolio, gain visibility in the community, and establish valuable connections. These initial contributions often open doors to paid positions within the same project or in other open source initiatives.

A career as an open source developer can be rewarding and full of opportunities, both for professional growth and for making a positive impact on the global community. First and foremost, it offers great flexibility and autonomy.

## Flexibility and Impact

Open source developers can work on projects from anywhere in the world, without the need to be physically present in an office or follow rigid schedules. Remote collaboration is common practice, allowing them to work at times that best suit their lifestyle.

Contributing to open source projects also allows developers to positively impact the global community. They can solve real problems and improve technologies used by many people daily.

Participating in these projects also provides continuous skill development, as developers work with the latest technologies and industry standards, receiving direct feedback from other experienced professionals, which accelerates their learning.

One of the great advantages of an open source career is the recognition and career opportunities it can provide. Significant contributions to open source projects increase the visibility and reputation of the developer in the tech community. There are various funding opportunities through grants and sponsorships from companies that support open source projects.

Professionals who stand out in this field usually have a proactive and self-taught profile. They can learn new technologies and tools on their own and demonstrate initiative to identify problems and create solutions. Communication skills are vital, as most of the work involves collaborating with other developers globally. Documenting work and clearly communicating ideas in discussions and pull requests is essential.

Open source developers need to have strong technical skills, being proficient in relevant programming languages and development tools. Familiarity with version control systems, especially Git, is crucial. A passion for technology and innovation is another factor that sets these professionals apart. They are motivated by the desire to create high-quality software that solves real problems and improves people's lives.

Adaptability and resilience are also important qualities, as the open source development environment can be dynamic and challenging. Developers need to be prepared to handle constant feedback and rapid changes.

There are many success stories that illustrate the importance and potential of an open source career. Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, started with an open source project that became one of the most important operating systems in the world. Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language, also launched his project as open source, which is now widely used.

**Moreover, a career built on open source software is meritocratic. If you stand out, it's because you are genuinely generating value. This can become a defense against arbitrary corporate systems that, in a layoff situation, end up discarding excellent professionals due to external reasons.**

### 11.1 Philosophy of Bitcoin Development

Being a Bitcoin developer involves significant ethical and social responsibility. Bitcoin is one of the best tools ever created to free humanity from the tyranny of oppressive governments and restrictive monetary policies.

To guide this ethical commitment, the Bitcoin community has compiled a document listing the main philosophical aspects of Bitcoin development. Learn more at [https://rosenbaum.se/btcphil/](https://rosenbaum.se/btcphil/)

### 11.2 Bitcoin FOSS Development

Bitcoin exemplifies the power and importance of FOSS in creating decentralized and innovative systems that promote freedom, security, and financial inclusion. The Bitcoin ecosystem, with its various open-source applications, continues to grow and evolve, offering vast opportunities for developers and users worldwide.

## Start Your Career in Bitcoin Open Source Development

https://bitcoindevs.xyz/career

**Why consider a career in bitcoin open source development?**
If you aspire to have professional freedom, work on something that will impact the lives of countless people across the world, write code that will span generations, and collaborate with some of the most gifted developers on the planet to solve some of the hardest technical problems of our age, then you are in the right place.

**Earning a grant for full-time bitcoin open source work**

Financial support for bitcoin open source work typically comes in the form of a grant. Grants usually last for one year and many are renewed.

Bitcoin funding is different from other open source and other cryptocurrency projects. Getting a grant in bitcoin is pretty straightforward. You either need someone to vouch for you or you need to do work - ideally both. While grant programs often have open applications, the secret to getting funding is not much of a secret. **Start doing the job for free. It establishes you as a contributor and proves your motivation. It shows that you are a good investment.** Applicants will have much more success if they do the work and then apply. For most jobs, the applicant is trying to convince the employer that they are capable of doing the job. But the job-seeker has no idea what the work or environment is actually like. In open source, one does not have to guess. Do the work. Demonstrate capability. Then ask for support.

Doing the work also means demonstrating your work. Not all work in open source work is as visible as writing code. The less visible work is no less valuable, but it is in your best interest to create artifacts of your effort. Transparency is your friend. If you learn something, it is helpful to codify it by writing a blog post or keeping a running log. I have seen some write a bi-weekly summary email tracking their progress. Code reviews used to be hard to track, but now GitHub does a better job crediting a green square. Taking long walks to reflect on how to approach a problem is necessary, but writing up your conclusions in a public place is valuable collateral that can forever serve as evidence of your progress.

### 11.5 Scalar School

Scalar School is a training school for future Bitcoin developers in Brazil, funded by the Human Rights Foundation.

Women are systematically denied opportunities to fully develop as developers in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The open source ecosystem, especially in Bitcoin development, has proven to be a hostile environment for women. Harassment, microaggressions, and exclusion are recurring issues that hinder women's participation and progress in this field. The lack of a safe and welcoming environment prevents many women from taking advantage of learning and technical growth opportunities.

Verbal microaggressions, differential treatment, social ostracism, and passive-aggressiveness disrupt women's learning processes, damaging their mental health and intellectual performance. We want to eliminate these intellectual obstacles and offer a community where women feel safe and supported to study and explore Bitcoin technology without hostile incidents.

To combat this hostility, we have decided to transform Scalar School into a women-only program. We aim to create a safe and supportive space where women can focus on studying complex technical topics without interruptions and without anyone questioning their intellectual potential.

These safe spaces are essential for protecting women's mental well-being and their ability to learn and grow. While the presence of technically qualified men can be beneficial, the greater problem is that women, when trying to find and fully belong to a study community, are being deprived of learning opportunities due to harassment, belittlement, and exclusion. This is a serious issue that must be addressed by the entire Bitcoin community, both nationally and internationally.

**Initially, we considered educating and controlling the open community with strict codes of conduct. However, we realized that an open program would lead to frequent incidents.** Currently, much of the open Bitcoin developer community in Brazil is essentially an organized hate group against women. To learn more, visit: [biohazel.github.io](https://biohazel.github.io) and read [Empowering Extreme Misogyny Through International Investments](https://bitfeminist.substack.com/p/empowering-extreme-misogyny-through).

We thought of women-only environments with the logic of a falling airplane. Our society is collapsing, and we have an obligation to put the oxygen mask on ourselves first. We are aware that it is naive to believe that we can change an entire social structure overnight. For this, we first need to strengthen ourselves as a minority by creating a women-only space. We are inspired by the success of the [Bitcoin Dada](https://btcdada.com/) project in bringing women to Bitcoin and hope to replicate this success in the Brazilian context.

Our curriculum is based on the best technical programs in the world, such as Base58, Chaincode Labs, Bitshala, "Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line," and canonical technical books in the field. Additionally, we actively promote community growth and strengthening, and we hope to soon resume Bitdevs Ribeirão Preto with a version for women-only.

Scalar School plays a vital role in the open source ecosystem, creating a community of builders and offering training for beginner developers who will be the future leaders in Bitcoin FOSS research and development programs.

Our dream is to become a global reference, an independent research and development group focused on the values of inclusion, freedom, and overcoming artificial barriers imposed by society. We want to experience the democratization of science and knowledge in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Women are a historically marginalized group in high-paying fields like technology. Our school is the first Bitcoin open source developer training project led by a woman in Brazil, making Scalar School a historic initiative in the national tech scene. (If I am mistaken, please introduce me to the first one.)

We are proud to announce that we have support and funding from the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) to build our community. This support allows us to offer high-quality training and create a safe environment for all.

For women developers, or those aspiring to be, we invite you to join this transformative journey by filling out our [interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFC8_rpRvvHzKA9h93gwcB2twNz7pw3nrqj1X2_op-zs2Zdg/viewform) for the first Full-Stack Bitcoin: From Mining to Lightning track.

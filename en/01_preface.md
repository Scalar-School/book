TO ALL THE HATERS AND DENIERS

WHO SAY BITCOIN IS USELESS OR DANGEROUS

BITCOIN IS OUT THERE, EVERY DAY, EVERY HOUR, IN COLLAPSED ECONOMIES AND IN THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE WORLD, HELPING PEOPLE THAT NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING TO HELP. BEING A LIFELINE FOR \*ANYONE\*

FIAT MONEY HAS FAILED MOST PEOPLE ON EARTH BADLY. OUR MONETARY AND "AID" SYSTEMS EXPLOIT AND REPRESS INSTEAD OF DELIVERING PROSPERITY AND FREEDOM

BUT BITCOIN IS SLOWLY, STEADILY, UNITING, ENRICHING AND LIBERATING THE WORLD

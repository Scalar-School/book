Until now, anything has been allowed as long as it involved building Bitcoin infrastructure, including the normalization and propagation of extreme misogyny. As the Brazilian rapper Projota said,

*"The constructions will be built. I learned from my father, who is a bricklayer."*

For better or for worse, Bitcoin will be built. In the current scenario, we need to deal with a persistent **social debt** left by the older developer communities in the ecosystem, who unfortunately still operate today. 

Fortunately, the situation is starting to change, allowing us to interact with the development ecosystem without having to go through them. Additionally, some of the older developers are respectful and well-intentioned individuals. We just have to find them.

Well then. We have our problems exposed, and we have Bitcoin as a powerful tool for financial freedom and building a new society. Some people will be interested in code development, while others will want to build a better world and will seek creative ways to do so.

And now, what will we build with all this knowledge, purchasing power, and financial freedom that Bitcoin brings us?

I will make a suggestion, but I also suggest you brainstorm and come up with many more—just as long as it doesn't involve building something that favors a retrograde, anti-feminist, misogynistic, and red pill world, please. No more of humanity's same old mistakes. **We need more feminism and the defense of women's and children's rights, not less.**

Did you know that the global baby products market was estimated at approximately USD 320.65 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% from 2024 to 2030? The main product segments include baby food, baby cosmetics and hygiene products, baby safety and convenience products, and baby clothing and accessories.

Among these products are a myriad of gadgets that babies don't need, but that are sold to innocent families who get their knowledge about the best ways to raise babies from Instagram influencers who are precisely selling products. Nothing could be more fiat-standard than that.

Babies don't have purchasing power, but they are co-opted to convince their parents to spend. Understanding their biological functioning makes it clear that investments in "things for their development" are basically unnecessary.

However, it is necessary to educate parents about how a baby works, both biologically and behaviorally, and the best ways to handle and interact with them. This, of course, does not yield profits. It takes time, interested families, and caregivers who are attentive trainers to demonstrate and explain why certain interactions and interventions are made, as well as why environments are prepared in specific ways—with less, not more.

The reality is similar to web3 and meme coins distracting people from Bitcoin. The true Bitcoin-standard treatment that babies deserve is far from being achieved, because the fiat system is manipulable to build things we don't need. But what if Bitcoin could solve this?

## Emmi Pikler's Revolutionary Childcare Practices

Emmi Pikler was a Hungarian pediatrician whose observations and practices revolutionized childcare. Working in an orphanage in Budapest, Pikler developed methods that emphasized children's autonomy and freedom of movement. Her approach aimed to respect each child's natural development pace, promoting healthy physical and emotional growth.

In traditional orphanages, children often suffered from a lack of stimulation, little interaction, and standardized care, resulting in physical and emotional developmental problems and difficulty fitting into society post-orphanage.

Pikler observed that these methods failed to provide an environment that supported children's healthy development. She set out to create a care system that met the individual needs of children and promoted their mental health. Imagine a world where even very poor children are perfectly well-adjusted and make the most of their neurological potential.

Pikler developed specific routines and practices that promoted children's independence and natural development, as well as respectful communication between caregiver and child, with well-defined boundaries from an early age.

- **Freedom of Movement:** Children were placed on the floor on their backs and encouraged to move freely. This allowed them to develop motor skills naturally, without direct caregiver intervention, and at their own pace.

- **Minimal Intervention:** Caregivers avoided manipulating or forcing positions on children, such as sitting them up or placing them on their stomachs before they were ready for these movements on their own.

- **Safe and Stimulating Environment:** Pikler introduced low furniture and structures like the Pikler Triangle, which encouraged safe exploration and physical development.

- **Attentive Observation:** Caregivers carefully observed each child to understand their needs and respond appropriately, without overstimulation or underestimation.

- **Respect for the Child's Time:** Each child's own development pace was respected, promoting confidence and emotional security.

Children cared for according to Pikler's methods left the orphanage with impeccable spinal postures, well-developed motor skills, and a strong sense of autonomy. They demonstrated greater resilience, confidence, and the ability to engage in healthy social interactions.

The success of children in Pikler's orphanage evidenced that respectful care based on autonomy and knowledge of human biology could result in well-adjusted and healthy adults, even in precarious conditions such as war orphanages. Magda Gerber, one of her students, brought this knowledge to the United States, where it became well known among high-income families in California. Nannies trained in the Pikler method are the highest-paid in Silicon Valley, and I have been one of them.

But this idea doesn't drive the baby products industry, nor does it go viral among the masses for the same reason. Only a new economic and value system could make these basic values the norm. **We are confident that the Bitcoin standard will also adjust our perception of values regarding human development, not just code development.**

## Focus on Bitcoin Development

However, first and foremost, we need to focus on developing Bitcoin as software and implementing Bitcoin itself. Through Bitcoin, we have the chance to build a better future where financial freedom, real freedom, and ethics walk hand in hand, creating a lasting positive impact on humanity.

Study Bitcoin, build Bitcoin, live Bitcoin. But know that human life goes beyond Bitcoin, and what we do and build with Bitcoin also matters.
